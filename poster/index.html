    	<div class="text">A FREE FAMILY AFFAIR! Families will have the opportunity to develop an appreciation for often overlooked local flora in this natural dyeing workshop. Using found and foraged flowers we will create natural flower prints by imprinting petals, roots, and herbs onto cotton fabric. We will also have an indigo vat ready for some dips. Each attendee will walk away with a flower dyed garment piece of cloth.</div>
    	<div class="text part2">Join us as we lay out dried flower petals and roll them up in our clothes to dye our clothes! You can see this demonstrated in the picture to the right.</div>
    	<div class="text part3">Here you can see our final products of flower dying! Sign up now to make your own!</div>
